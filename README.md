# Chinook Database queries

In this project, I will be using SQL to extract data from a database to answer important business questions. The database used is chinook.db which  is a sample database available for SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, etc. It can be created by running a single SQL script.  

The Chinook data represents a digital media store containing information about artists, their albums,sales information about the albums & tracks as well as customers and employee information.
